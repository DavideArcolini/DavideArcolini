### Hello there 👋

My name is Davide Arcolini 🤓. 

I am currently enrolled in the **CyberSecurity** track at **Politecnico di Torino**, Italy. \
Also, I am participating to the **CyberChallenge.IT** edition of CTFs. 

On my profile you can find most of the courses I attended during my studies. The repositories for these courses are named `PoliTo_<course_tag>`.\
Moreover, `PNRGs` contains my essay (and code implementation) on Pseudo-Random Number Generator based on Logistic Chaotic Map and Generalized Lorenz Systems.

Enjoy 🧙🏼‍♂️
