### Hello there 👋

My name is Davide Arcolini 🤓. Happy to see you on my GitHub page! Hope you'll find here what you need or what you are looking for. Take a look around and *may the force be with you*.

#### Who I am and what I am doing
- Since I was a kid, I used to mess up computers because I had no idea of what I was doing. Today, nothing has changed. However, in 2021 I got a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from **Politecnico di Torino** in Italy.

- Now, I am enrolled in the Computer Engineering Master's Courses, majoring in **CyberSecurity**, still at **Politecnico di Torino**.\
Moreover, I am participating in the 2022 edition of **CyberChallenge.IT**, the italian training program for ethical hackers! 🧑‍💻 Here, besides playing CTF, I am learning how to break stuff by understanding how things works, such as: cryptography, web appications, reverse engineering, etc...

- On my profile you can find most of the courses I had attended during my studies. The repositories for these courses are named `PoliTo_<course_tag>`, such as: 
  - `PoliTo_OS` refers to the Operating System course;
  - `PoliTo_SDP` refers to the System and Device Programming course;
  - `PoliTo_CA` refers to the Computer Architectures course;
  - and so on.

Moreover, there is a special folder, called `PNRGs`, which contains my essay (and code implementation) on Pseudo-Random Number Generator based on Logistic Chaotic Map and Generalized Lorenz Systems.

Enjoy 🧙🏼‍♂️
